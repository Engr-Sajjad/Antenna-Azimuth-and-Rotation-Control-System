Project Scope and Control Objectives
 Purpose:
      To automatically control the azimuth (horizontal rotation) and elevation (tilt) of a telecom antenna.
      Maintain precise angular positioning using a closed-loop feedback system (from sensors like rotary encoders or potentiometers).
      Support remote monitoring and control via a telemetry interface (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/LoRa).
