# üì° Antenna Azimuth and Rotation Control System

## üß≠ Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **closed-loop antenna positioning system** capable of **automatic azimuth (horizontal)** and **elevation (vertical)** control.  
The system ensures accurate antenna alignment for cellular or communication towers using **STM32 microcontroller-based control**, **motor drivers**, and **position feedback sensors**.

The final design will be **production-grade**, including:
- Optimized firmware (PID closed-loop control)
- Hardware protection (limit switches, current limits)
- Remote monitoring & telemetry interface
- Production-ready PCB design and documentation

## üéØ Objectives
1. Maintain antenna azimuth and elevation automatically with ¬±0.5¬∞ precision.  
2. Implement a **closed-loop control algorithm (PID)** for smooth and stable positioning.  
3. Support **remote angle commands and live telemetry** (position, status, faults).  
4. Provide **fail-safe operation** using limit switches and emergency stop routines.  
5. Deliver a **production-ready PCB**, firmware, and documentation.
